> Goal: Train, test, and tune linear regression, decision tree, and random forest models to determine which best predicts bike rentals.

Many American cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. Washington, D.C. is one of these cities. The District collects detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day.

Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto compiled this data into a CSV file. The file contains `17380 rows`, with each row representing the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day. You can download the data from the **[University of California, Irvine's website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)**. I am working with data for the city of Ames, Iowa from 2006-2010.
