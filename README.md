### Some history
Before the year 2000, institutions like the United States Post Office used handwriting recognition software to read addresses, zip codes, and more. 
One of their approaches, which consists of pre-processing handwritten images then feeding to a neural network model is detailed in 
**[this paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.852.5499&rep=rep1&type=pdf)**.

### Goals
* Explore why image classification is a hard task
* Observe the limitations of traditional machine learning models for image classification
* Train, test, and improve a few different deep neural networks for image classification
* Build models that can classify handwritten digits.
